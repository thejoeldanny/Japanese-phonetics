# Japanese-phonetics
Hello There!! This Python program is used to print every phonetic present in the japanese language to write and practice on paper.
There are many different types of letters in Japanese language.
I have completed this program on a very basic level

Things I would like to add to this program:-
  1. Use UNICODE values to get the letters of japanese to check what I written is right or wrong
  2. Build a frontend to this code so it would be runnable like an application.
  3. Add Auto-next method to go to the next letter automatically.
